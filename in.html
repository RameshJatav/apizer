    <p class="mb-4">Good morning/afternoon sir/madam,</p>

    <p class="mb-4">My name is <strong>Ramesh Jatav</strong>. I have around <strong>2 years of experience as a Backend Developer</strong>, primarily working with <strong>Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB</strong>.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">I started my career at <strong>ZITS, Alwar</strong>, where I worked on building RESTful APIs for an internal product. I learned a lot about backend architecture, middleware, JWT authentication, and working with MongoDB databases.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">After that, I joined <strong>KASHISHINDIA PVT LTD, Jagatpura Jaipur</strong>, where I handled more complex features like user authentication, file uploads, integrating third-party APIs, and optimizing backend performance.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">I’m comfortable with using <strong>Git, Postman, Jira</strong>, and have also worked with <strong>AWS basics and Docker</strong> to some extent.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">I enjoy solving backend problems and writing clean, scalable code. I’m now looking for a new opportunity where I can grow further, take on more challenging tasks, and contribute to a good tech team.</p>

    <p class="mt-6">Thank you for giving me this opportunity to introduce myself.</p>
